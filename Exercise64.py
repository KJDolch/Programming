# Create a list with at least 15 random entries
# Iterate over it with a for loop and add up the elements
# Create one if statement in your loop that canâ€™t be true a
# add a pass
# Include a second if statement in your loop that breaks the loop if your sum gets bigger than a threshold (you chose)
# Include a third if statement in your loop that uses continue if the current entry of your list is in a specific range, eg. 50 to 60, and prints out something in all other cases (use else)
# Print out the sum and the number of index
